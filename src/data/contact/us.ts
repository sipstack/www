		title: "How does billing work?",
		content:
			"Activated services that require billing will need a valid credit card to enable features and unlock capabilities. Billing and invoices are generated on the first of every month for the previous monthâ€™s usage. Invoices are billed in USD by default and in CAD for Canadian Partners.",
	},
	{
		title: "Do I need a credit card to create an account?",
		content:
			"No! Many products have a free basic/starter tier which covers access for most cases, and so we do not require a credit card. For products and services that do incur usage charges, a credit card payment method must be added in order to unlock the feature.",
	},
	{
		title: "Are there alternative payment methods for frequent users?",
		content:
			"This is a common request. Partner accounts that expect to incur more than $10,000 USD in monthly recurring charges can contact our billing team for additional payment options.",
	},
	{
		title: "How secure is SIPSTACK and its suite of products?",
		content:
			"Very! SIPSTACK suite of products & services were built by an industry leader and security expert. Securing hosts managed within Partner clouds or on-premise requires additional security based on the use case for the deployment. Cloud UC does include base level security rules, iptables and access to other security products; however, due to the many different environments and ways to secure equipment, Cloud UC hosts are managed by the Partner directly and not SIPSTACK.",

		title: "Can I sign up for dedicated / enterprise support?",
		content: "Yes, enterprise support will be available in Q2 of 2023 and can be added from your Partner Portal. Pricing will be announced at that time.",

		title: "How does SIPSTACK AI/ML work?",
		content:
			"We use various machine learning tools in different areas of the platform. We are continually learning about call patterns, and the authenticity of those calls to help provide the most accurate and reliable risk assesment to users of the system and through Smart CNAM and Whois. SIPSTACK Meta (project name) for our AI/ML is continually expanding its capabilities, ingestion rates, data & relationship comprehension.",

	{
		title: "Do you really think you can stop fraudulent calls?",
		content:
			"Yes, our core mission is to end the epidemic that is defrauding good people either through spoofing, robocalls, phishing or other means of scamming folks over the phone. Every product we release is meticulously crafted and though of to both help enhance telecommunication products, but also drive verifiable data into our AI/ML to always provide the most accurate information possible.",
