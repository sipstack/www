It is important to sign up knowing the number of API requests in your system each month to avoid constantly exceeding your credit limit. However, if you want to test our system with a lower subscription fee this is okay, but you need to remember that when you see your API requests approaching double the subscription amount then you might want to upgrade to a higher or contact billing@sipstack.com to authorize a payment from your credit card to keep the requests flowing or wait until next month to resume your requests. For customers with more than 2,000,000 monthly API requests please contact billing@sipstack.com.
