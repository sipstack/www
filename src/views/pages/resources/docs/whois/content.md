## Overview ##

Whois by SIPSTACK is the world’s most advanced caller ID reverse lookup tool. It is a community driven super tool that was built to help eradicate spam and fraud from the telecommunications industry. It allows users to search a phone number that is calling them, or has called them in the past, to determine its level of safety. Users can tag a phone number as spam or safe and even leave a written review to let other users know more about that number. Whois also provides further details on specific phone numbers in our database, such as caller ID, region, carrier, emails, social media profiles, and more.
You can create an account, which will give you immediate access to the SIPSTACK Whois user portal. This will allow you to create Caller ID profiles, add and verify your phone numbers to help them get a higher score rating, and see all of your past reviews.
