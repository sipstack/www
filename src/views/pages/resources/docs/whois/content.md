## Overview ##

Whois by SIPSTACK is the world’s most advanced AI driven phone number lookup tool. It is a community driven super tool that was built to help eradicate spam and fraud from the telecommunications industry. Whois allows you to search any North American number and get a Risk Score Rating along with additional caller information. You can tag a phone number as spam or safe and even leave a written review to let other users know more about that number. Whois also provides further details on specific phone numbers in our database, such as caller ID, region, carrier, emails, social media profiles, and much more. You can verify your number, which will give you immediate access to the SIPSTACK Whois user portal. This will allow you to take control of your profile, increase your caller transperancy and risk score rating and protect your number from spam calls.

## How it Works?

### Homepage

On the homepage, you will see a search bar. Simply enter the phone number you wish to search and click 'Search'.

The website will then generate a Risk Score Rating based on our proprietary algorithm and various factors, including the phone number's history, location, and type of call.

### Risk Rating Score

The [Risk Score Rating](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/general/risk-score/) ranges from 0 to 5, with a lower rating indicating a greater risk of fraud or spam. You can also view additional caller information, including the caller's name, address, and even social media profiles.

You can also report a spam or fraudulent call by clicking the 'Thumbs Down' button and you can also mark a call as safe by clicking the 'Thumbs Up' button. This helps our AI model improve and better protect users from future scams.

### Verifying Your Number

In order to better protect yourself from spam calls, we recommend verifying your phone number with SIPSTACK.

To verify your phone number, click on login, then enter your phone number, at which point you will receive a text message with a Two-Factor Authentication code. Simply enter the code, and your phone number will be verified, giving you a green verification badge next to your caller ID when someone searches your phone number.

### Profile

Once verified, you can add as much or as little information as you’d like to your profile in the Profile tab. However, keep in mind the more you add, the higher your “Caller Transparency” will be, which means that our AI algorithm will rate your phone number higher. 
 
### About

Similarly, the About tab allows you to add further information to your profile, such as your company, description, socials, and more. What you decide to include is up to you, but it will influence your Caller Transparency. 
 

### Preferences

You can choose what information is shown on your public profile by using the toggles in the Preferences tab.
 

### Account

If you’d like to copy your profile over to another number, you can do so in the Account tab. Enter the new phone number and the two-factor authentication code you receive, and then click copy profile.
This tab can also be used for deleting your profile if you choose to do so. 
 
So there you have it! Whether you're looking to avoid spam calls, protect yourself from fraud, or simply learn more about a caller, we've got you covered.
