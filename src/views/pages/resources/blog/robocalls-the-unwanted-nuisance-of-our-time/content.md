Robocalls are automated phone calls that have become a major problem for many people. They are often used for telemarketing or political campaigns, but they can also be used for scams or fraud. Robocalls are annoying and disruptive, and they can also be dangerous if they lead to identity theft or other types of fraud.

## How Robocalls Work ##

Robocalls are made using computer software that automatically dials phone numbers and plays a pre-recorded message. The technology used for robocalls is cheap and widely available, which means that anyone can use it. In addition, many robocalls use spoofing techniques to make it look like they are coming from a different phone number, which makes it difficult for people to block them.

## The Problem with Robocalls ##

Robocalls are a major problem for several reasons. First, they are annoying and disruptive. They often come at inconvenient times, such as dinner time or when you're in the middle of something important. Second, they can be dangerous. Scammers often use robocalls to try to trick people into giving them personal information or money. Third, they can be difficult to block. Despite efforts by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and phone companies to block robocalls, they continue to be a major problem.
