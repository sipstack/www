The graph reveals that robocalls with B-level attestation surged from 21.21% in August to 32.46% in September. Similarly, those with C-level attestation jumped from 16.18% in August to 26.78% in September. These are the peak numbers within the last half-year and throughout 2023. Furthermore, the overall percentage of robocalls increased from 6.45% in August to 8.02% in September.

**STIR/SHAKEN Participation: Is Momentum Slowing Down?**

The STIR/SHAKEN initiative has seen impressive growth, but recent numbers suggest a potential plateau.

As the graph displays, the number of SHAKEN authorized providers has been on the rise. Yet, with only 15 new providers in September, the growth rate might be stabilizing.

**Coverage of STIR/SHAKEN: Some Setbacks and Slow Gains**

Effective call authentication is vital for STIR/SHAKEN's success. The recent figures, however, present mixed results.

**Figure 5.** _The Percentage of Signed Calls at Termination Last 6 Months_

The chart indicates a downward trend. From 34% in July, the figure dropped nearly 3% in August, with only a 0.5% recovery in September.

This representation shows that calls with full attestation reached 24.5% in July but fell to 21.5% in August. September saw a slight increase to 22.5%.

**Robocall Patterns Among Top Signers**

The top SHAKEN-authorized providers, particularly prolific robocall signers, show distinctive patterns.

**Figure 7.** _Robocall Percentage by Attestationâ€”Prolific Robocall Signers by Robocall %_

The figure indicates a steady growth in robocalls with A- and B-level attestations from these top signers. Astonishingly, 88.46% of their B-level attested calls and 79.4% of A-level attested ones were robocalls. However, the trend for C-level attested robocalls is declining.

For combatting robocalls effectively, considering the reputation of STIR/SHAKEN signers during call analysis is crucial.

**In Conclusion:**

- Robocalls with B- and C-level attestations have seen a sharp increase.
- The top robocall signers have higher percentages of A- and B-level attested calls.
- STIR/SHAKEN participation might be reaching a plateau.
- Coverage by STIR/SHAKEN dipped in August with only a minor recovery in September.
