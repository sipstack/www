As telecommunication fraud continues to grow exponentially, with reported losses in 2022 of $530 million in Canada[^1] and nearly $40 billion in the United States[^2], it’s never been more important to stay informed and vigilant. There are many different phone scams that contributed to these enormous numbers. Among the top three in Canada are Chinese language phone scams. (The top two are Amazon scams and credit card scams.)

## What are Chinese Language Phone Scams?
Chinese language phone scams refer to robocalls in Chinese that scare the recipient into thinking that there is some kind of urgent problem, which they need to speak to a representative about in order to solve it. The scams can take on many forms, with robocallers often impersonating the Chinese Embassy or Consulate, the Beijing Police, or a delivery agency. 
 
The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre says they specifically target Asian communities in Canada, especially those who speak Chinese, and are meant to be intimidating and threatening, so that victims will engage and be at risk of losing money.

## Examples of Chinese Language Phone Scams

The following are verbatim examples, albeit translated into English:

- “Chinese Embassy voice notification: You have an important notice that you have not received. Please press 9 for inquiries.”

“Customs stopped a suspicious package containing many bank cards and you are the subject of an investigation.”
“There are fraudulent funds in your account and we need your banking information to verify.
“You must visit this police website to verify your identity and provide a copy of your passport.”

According to a CBC report last August, twelve Chinese post-secondary students in Waterloo were scammed out of $1.76 million by scammers impersonating law enforcement officers or courier companies.[^3]

Although Chinese Canadians are specifically targeted, the Chinese language scam has impacted many others as well. In 2018, the US Federal Trade Commission warned citizens to beware of scammers impersonating the Chinese Consulate, and that same year, the Massachusetts Office of Consumer Affairs warned via blog post that the Chinese Embassy scam was on the rise in Massachusetts. Since those who speak Chinese will be more inclined to take the threats seriously, they are more at risk, but it’s still important to recognize that nobody is immune from this scam.

## Tips to Protect Yourself

1) If you receive a call or text from an unknown number, use [Whois by SIPSTACK](https://whois.sipstack.com/) to see the number’s risk rating score. This will allow you to determine whether or not it is safe before you decide to respond.  
2) If you find out the number does belong to a scammer, rate and review it in the Whois portal, so members of your community can protect themselves as well.
3) Create an account and verify your number with Whois. This will put you on the “Do Not Call List” from verified spam numbers and other unwanted telemarketers. 
4) Generally ignore calls from unknown numbers that contain Chinese recordings, especially if you understand the language and are being threatened or intimidated into taking action.
