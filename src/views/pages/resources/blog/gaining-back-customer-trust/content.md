In 2022, telecommunication fraud continued to grow exponentially with reported losses of $530 million in [Canada](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-canada/)[^1] and nearly $40 billion in the [United States](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-the-us/)[^2]. With robocalls to US consumers totalling 50.3 billion[^3], it’s easy to see why 94% of customers refuse to answer  calls from unknown numbers.  

If you’re a business, you’ll want to be aware of these facts and stay proactive in combatting trust erosion with consumers. Simply put, the more information you make accessible to your customers when trying to call them, the more likely they will be to answer your calls. One of the most effective ways to do this is through branded caller ID.

## What is Branded Caller ID?
Branded caller ID refers to projecting your company name, logo, and reason for calling customers, so they’ll know your calls are from you rather than a robocaller or scammer. It is an invaluable tool that can:
- Promote a real and trusting connection between you and your customers.
- Keep your agents up to date with the best training available and optimize your IVRs.
- Help you prioritize what information is most important to your customers and their loyalty.
- Analyze useful data regarding first call closure, conversion rates, and call abandonment rates.
- Familiarize your customers with your company’s brand and build customer confidence by connecting them to legitimate calls.

There are many factors to running a successful business, but without customer trust, almost all of them will fall short. Consider Branded Caller ID to help instil trust and loyalty in your customers as we all continue to navigate the rough waters of telecommunications fraud.
