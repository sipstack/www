The following is a summary of the noteworthy proposed changes found in the FCC's report-and-order:

- The first non-gateway intermediate provider in a call path will be required to use STIR/SHAKEN to authenticate any unauthenticated caller ID information for the SIP calls that they receive directly from an originating service provider.
- All providers will be required to take reasonable steps to mitigate illegal robocalls and file mitigation plans in the Robocall Mitigation Database (RMDB).
- Any provider whose certification is deficient or who accepts calls directly from a provider not listed in the RMDB will face enforcement action from the FCC, including getting delisted from the RMDB.
- Deficient filings in the RMDB will result in an expedited delisting.
- Increased forfeiture penalties.
- Satellite providers that do not originate calls with NANP numbers will no longer have to use STIR/SHAKEN.
- Small satellite providers will have an ongoing extension from TRACED Act obligations
- Additional RMDB information will be required, including:
    - Whether the filer is a voice service provider serving end users, a wholesale provider originating calls on behalf of other providers, or a voice service provider without a STIR/SHAKEN obligation.
    - The filer’s OCN, provided it has one.
