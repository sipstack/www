When people are asked what age groups are most susceptible to telecommunications fraud, a common answer is senior citizens. However, according to Protecting Older Consumers: A Report of the FTC (Federal Trade Commission), adults aged 60 and above are actually the least likely of any age group to report losing money to fraud. The kicker is that when they do experience fraud, it statistically results in higher losses than any other age group.

According to the FTC, some of the most popular scams out there specifically target seniors. This article will explore three in particular to look out for.

## Medicare scams 
There are several different kinds of Medicare scams. The most common is a scammer impersonating a government official and telling their victim that they need to replace their Medicare card. In doing so, they ask their victim for their current Medicare number, which can be used to obtain personal information, like Social Security number, financial account numbers, or insurance information. It can also be used to bill false services to Medicare. 

Another Medicare scam involves calls or fake ads that offer large discounts on health insurance, but are really intended to obtain personal information.

## Grandparent Scams
Grandparent scams https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-growing-risk-of-the-grandparent-scam-in-canada/ refers to scammers who call senior citizens, pretending to be their grandchild in an emergency crisis. The details of said emergency may vary (car accident, legal peril, robbery, health problems, trouble returning home from a foreign country), but all of them share one thing in common: The "grandchild" needs money from their grandparent immediately to help solve their problem.

## Social Security Scams
This scam refers to scammers who call victims, telling them that their Social Security benefits are ending or their Social Security number will be suspended unless they pay immediately. Payments are often requested via untraceable methods such as wire transfer, cryptocurrency, or even gift cards. The scammer is usually seeking money, personal information, or both and may sometimes even threaten the victim with getting arrested if they don’t comply.
