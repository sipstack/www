As telecommunication fraud continues to grow exponentially, with reported losses in 2022 of $530 million in Canada[^1] and nearly $40 billion in the United States[^2], it’s clear that spam affects pretty much everyone. There are certain groups, however, who are specifically targeted by scammers and thus more vulnerable than everyone else. These groups include seniors, recent immigrants, children, and those who are financially insecure. If you belong, or know anyone who belongs, to these groups, it’s important to stay informed and be extra cautious when it comes to spam. 

## Seniors
Much has been written already about [how spam affect seniors](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/how-scams-affect-seniors/) including specific scams like medicare scams, social security scams, and [the grandparent scam](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-growing-risk-of-the-grandparent-scam-in-canada/). 

But are you ready for an unexpected stat? According to Protecting Older Consumers: A Report of the FTC (Federal Trade Commission), adults aged 60 and above are actually the least likely of any age group to report losing money to fraud. The kicker is that when they do experience fraud, it statistically results in higher losses than any other age group. This is why seniors have to be extra careful with calls from unknown numbers. 

## Recent Immigrants
New immigrants are often less familiar with the laws of their new country, which makes them particularly susceptible to government [imposter scams](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/how-businesses-are-impacted-by-imposter-scams/). There have been increasing reports of scammers targeting immigrants by placing calls to specific area codes where recent immigrants are likely to reside, such as border regions or urban areas. 

Particularly popular among these is the Chinese-language scam, which remains one of the top three phone scams in Canada. These start with a robocall in Chinese, pretending that there is some kind of a problem, and then prompting the victim to speak to a representative from the Chinese Embassy, the police, or Immigration Services. Of course, they are then redirected to someone trying to scam them out of money or personal information, which could result in huge losses down the road. 

## Children
According to a 2021 census by Common Sense Media, approximately one third of children ages 8-9 own a mobile phone, and by age 18 that number jumps all the way up to 93%.[^3] For obvious reasons, children (especially younger ones) are generally more susceptible to falling for a scam and providing private information to scammers than adults are, and should be protected accordingly. 

## Financially Insecure Populations
Scammers love taking advantage of desperation, insecurity, and uncertainty, which makes those struggling with money very vulnerable. A popular scam in the U.S. involved “debt relief”, where scammers targeted consumers with credit card debt, fraudulently offering to negotiate with their creditors for a hefty up-front fee, and then of course not delivering on any debt relief whatsoever. Similarly, student loan scams falsely promise to reduce loan amounts, taking advantage of confusion over real governmental programs that legitimately pause or eliminate student loan debt.
