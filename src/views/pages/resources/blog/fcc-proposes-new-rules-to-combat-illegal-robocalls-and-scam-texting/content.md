On March 16, 2023, the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) adopted some important changes pertaining to illegal robocalls and scam texting. The following is a summary of the Report and Order.

## Changes to Combat Illegal Robocalls

For robocalls, the new rules require intermediate providers to implement [STIR/SHAKEN](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/regulatory/what-is-stir-shaken/) to improve tracebacks and blocking. Although the FCC has widely implemented STIR/SHAKEN, some originating providers are not capable of using it, whereas some others have deliberately failed to authenticate calls. Now that the next provider in the call path is required to authenticate calls, the FCC is closing a gap in the caller ID authentication regime, which will help identify and block illegal robocalls.

The new rules will also expand robocall mitigation requirements for all providers. All providers are now required to take “reasonable steps” to mitigate illegal robocall traffic and submit a certification and mitigation plan to the FCC’s [Robocall Mitigation Database](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/regulatory/what-is-the-robocall-mitigation-database/) regardless of their STIR/SHAKEN implementation status.

The Report and Order adopted is intended to further improve the FCC’s robocall enforcement tools. Specifically, the FCC has stated that violations of its mandatory blocking rules could result in substantial fines using per call forfeiture calculations, as well as removal from the Robocall Mitigation Database to all intermediate providers and an expedited removal process for providers submitting facially deficient certifications. Lastly, the new rules will enforce consequences for repeat offenders of robocall mitigation rules.

## Changes to Combat Scam Texting

For scam texting, the new rules now require mobile service providers to block specific robotext messages that are unlikely to transmit text messages, and therefore highly likely to be illegal. This includes invalid, unallocated, or unused numbers. It also includes numbers whose subscribers have self-identified as never sending text messages, and numbers that government agencies and other legitimate entities identify as not used for texting.

Another new rule requires mobile wireless providers to establish a point of contact for text senders. In other cases, providers must require their aggregator partners or blocking contractors to establish the point of contact, which senders can use to inquire about blocked texts.

Lastly, the FCC is seeking public comment on further proposals to require providers to block texts from entities the FCC has cited as illegal robotexters. It also wishes to clarify that Do-Not-Call Registry protections apply to text messaging and closing the lead generator loophole. This allows companies to use a single consumer consent to deliver robocalls and text messages from multiple marketers on subjects that are misleading to consumers. The FCC will also seek further public comment on text authentication measures and other proposals to continue to fight illegal scam robotexts.
