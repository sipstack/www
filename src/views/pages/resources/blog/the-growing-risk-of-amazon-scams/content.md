Amazon is the largest and most popular online retailer in the world… Which means scammers are all over it! In fact, Amazon scams are the number one phone scam in both Canada and the UK, and the number two phone scam in the US. Since so many people have accounts with Amazon, scammers know that making a multitude of random robocalls, emails, and texts will likely succeed in reaching many Amazon users.

Amazon scams can take on many different forms, but one is by far the most common. In 2022, fake order confirmations accounted for more than 50% of the Amazon impersonation scams reported by customers.[^1] These unsolicited communications usually ask you to act urgently to confirm a “purchase”, which you of course did not actually make. When you attempt to cancel the fake order by clicking a link or calling the alleged “customer service” number, scammers then try to steal your personal or financial information.

## Examples of Amazon Phone Scams

Here are some verbatim examples of Amazon scam phone calls:

- “Hello. This is Amazon. This call is to authorize a payment of $999. We would like to inform you that there is an order placed for an Apple iPhone 11 Pro using your Amazon account. If you do not authorize this order press 1, or press 2 to authorize this order.”

- “This is a confirmation call from Amazon regarding your purchase of iPhone 13 Pro Max and Apple Airpods, totaling $1499. But we have found some suspicious activities in your account while processing the payment. So in order to cancel your order, kindly press 1 to speak with the Amazon fraud department.”

- “Hello. Amazon Express notice. A courier delivered twice and no one has signed for it. For details, please press 1.”

Other examples of Amazon scams include offering phoney gift cards or luring you in to cancel a fake monthly fee. Again, both are attempts to acquire your personal or financial information, which could result in massive financial losses and even bigger inconveniences.

## Tips to Protect Yourself From Amazon Scams

1. If someone calls or texts you saying they’re from Amazon, use [Whois by SIPSTACK](https://whois.sipstack.com/) to check the unknown number. This will allow you to see what rating this number has and whether or not it is safe before you decide to respond.  
2. If you find out the number belongs to a scammer, rate and review it in the Whois portal, so members of your community can protect themselves as well.
3. Create an account and verify your number with Whois. This will put you on the “Do Not Call List” from verified spam numbers and other unwanted telemarketers.
4. If you receive a message about the purchase of a product or service, do not respond or click on the attached link. First, log into your Amazon account or use the Amazon mobile app to confirm whether or not it is really in your purchase history. You will often find that it is not. 
5. Understand that Amazon does not ask for payment over the phone or email; they only do so in their mobile app, on their website, or in one of their physical stores. They will certainly never contact you to make a payment or bank transfer on another website.
6. Beware of false urgency. Scammers often try to create a sense of urgency to manipulate you into falling for the scam. Amazon will never do this. 
7. If you’re ever unsure or feeling suspicious about an interaction, simply disengage from the potential scammer and contact Amazon directly through their app or website. This will clear up any questions you might have. 
8. If you receive any communication from a potential scammer pretending to be Amazon, report it immediately. Customers can use the <a href= 'https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GRGRY7AQ3LMPXVCV' target="_blank"> Amazon self-service tool </a> and those who are not customers can email Amazon at stop-spoofing@amazon.com.
