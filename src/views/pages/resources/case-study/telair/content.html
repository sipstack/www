VoIP has invaded the marketing space. To effectively communicate with their customers, businesses want plug and play VoIP solutions that can be customized at the click of a button.</p>
<h2 id="the-answer" tabindex="-1">The Answer</h2>

<li>More autonomy within TELAIR's web portals</li>
<li>Advanced features setting TELAIR apart with competitive features and services</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-problem" tabindex="-1">The Problem</h2>

<p>TELAIR has always had a growth mindset, and they want to find an intelligent way to scale their business. They've recognized that building out unique customizations for each customer has several limitations:</p>

<h2 id="the-solution" tabindex="-1">The Solution</h2>
<p>SIPSTACK was developed for IT providers and savvy business owners. All elements of telephony (PBX, phone lines, fax, conferencing) can be deployed in less than 25 seconds. SIPSTACK also has unique security measures in place to move its voice traffic.</p>
<h3 id="sip-protocol" tabindex="-1">SIP Protocol</h3>
<p>SIPSTACK's unique SIP protocol approach operates on ports invisible to port-sniffers and hackers. This technology allows SIPSTACK to effectively eliminate the siphoning of unauthorized call minutes and saves its VoIP users tens of thousands of dollars in overage charges.</p>
<h3 id="ai-tools" tabindex="-1">AI Tools</h3>
<p>SIPSTACK uses smart AI tools to continuously monitor a company's call destination pattern. When a call goes to an irregular destination that looks illegitimate, SIPSTACK's AI shuts off the company's long-distance calling and sends a notification to the customer's NOC team with information about when the call was attempted and the IP address the call originated from.</p>
<p>But what really makes the overhaul of TELAIR's legacy software and equipment worth it for TELAIR is that customization is also just a few clicks away!</p>
<figure><img src="/assets/img/resources/blog/telair/four.png" alt=""><figcaption>Use Cases</figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="use-cases" tabindex="-1">Use Cases</h2>
<p>TELAIR has already been able to use SIPSTACK's APIs to support two distinct use cases. The first one is a CRM integration for a real estate brokerage. The second one is an order management system for a pizza franchise. For both cases, TELAIR leveraged SIPSTACK's ability to seamlessly integrate with third-party applications to provide each customer with the exact customizations they needed. The President of TELAIR, Michelle S describes each use case in detail.</p>
<h3 id="crm-integration" tabindex="-1">CRM Integration</h3>
<p><em>'Our client's paging system was quite antiquated. When a lead called in, the receptionist would have to manually type in the contact information and send it to the real estate agent. The client wanted to minimize the probability of losing a lead because of human error. By integrating their VoIP service with a third-party CRM, they would be able to track each lead through every stage of the sales funnel.'</em></p>
<h3 id="order-management" tabindex="-1">Order Management</h3>
<p><em>'The client wanted a VoIP solution that could help their delivery team coordinate web orders, customers get accurate wait times based on the number of staff working at each pizza location and the ability for staff at each pizza location torecommend pizzas based on a customer's previous order.'</em></p>
