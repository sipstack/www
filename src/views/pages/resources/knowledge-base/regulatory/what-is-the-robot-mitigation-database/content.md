According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), unwanted phone calls are among the top complaints for American consumers. To help this solve this problem, the FCC created the Robocall Mitigation Database.

The Robocall Mitigation Database (RMDB) is a way for voice service providers to establish that they have implemented the required authentication framework and are taking “specific, actionable steps” to put a stop to the origination of illegal robocalls. All voice service providers were required to have registered by June 30, 2021, and if they hadn’t done so by September 28, 2021, the FCC had directed downstream carriers to begin blocking their traffic.

## How Does One Access the RMDB?

Access to the Robocall Mitigation Database is available using <a href= 'https://fccprod.servicenowservices.com/rmd?id=rmd_welcome/' target="_blank"> this public link. </a>

## Who has to Register to the RMDB?
Any organization that qualifies as a "voice service provider" must register in the RMDB, and therefore must also participate in all call blocking directives that have been dictated.

Under the Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence (TRACED) Act, the FCC defines a voice service provider as any IP-enabled voice services that are:

- Outbound in nature.
- Inbound in nature.
- Intermediate to appropriately support the [STIR/SHAKEN](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/regulatory/what-is-stir-shaken/) authentication framework.

Because of the broad scope of this definition, a variety of voice service providers are required to register with the RMDB, including the majority of organizations who have purchased enterprise or retail-oriented services from their provider.

## How Does One Register for the RMDB?

Registration is a very simple process that only takes a few minutes. You can do so <a href= 'https://fccprod.servicenowservices.com/rmd?id=rmd_welcome' target="_blank"> here. </a>   

## What if a Carrier Doesn’t Register?
If a carrier chooses not to register for the RMDB, their service will likely be terminated until proper registration is complete.

The FCC's website also lists other potential penalties for failing to register, which include:

- The FCC itself may directly fine any provider that has not taken the appropriate registration steps.
- Other providers may not accept any call traffic that originates from voice service providers that are not in the Robocall Mitigation Database.

## What Makes a Robocall Mitigation Plan “Sufficient"?
Although no comprehensive checklist exists as of yet, the FCC has an Enforcement Bureau in place to review each voice service provider's robocall mitigation plan to make sure they are meeting their obligations.

Additionally, the FCC has listed some standards that a program must meet to be considered “sufficient”:

- It includes a detailed outline of all best practices that are being reasonably followed in an attempt to "significantly reduce" any illegal robocalls over a network.
- It complies with the best practices that the FCC has outlined via their website.
The voice service provider in question also participates in standard industry traceback protocols.

## Can You see if Your Voice Provider is Registered?

Yes, you can do so <a href= 'https://fccprod.servicenowservices.com/rmd?id=rmd_welcome/' target="_blank"> here. </a> Then either download a copy of the database or view the database in your browser, which also allows you to manually search for all voice service providers who have taken the appropriate registration steps.

## Is STIR/SHAKEN the Same as Robocall Mitigation?
No. The Robocall Mitigation Database and STIR/SHAKEN compliance are definitely similar in that they share a common goal to solve the same problem. However, they are ultimately unique and must both be complied to separately. Even if a voice service provider has already become compliant with the STIR/SHAKEN authentication framework, they are still required to register with the Robocall Mitigation Database.

## Will the RMDB Eradicate Robocalls?
The FCC expects to see a significant reduction in robocalls moving forward. However, the RMDB alone will not totally solve the robocall problem. It requires the support of both voice service providers and their end users, as well as all the other efforts of the FCC, to eradicate robocalls once and for all.
