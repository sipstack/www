You can use an MMS-enabled SIPSTACK phone number (long code) to send and receive MMS messages in Canada and US. Please note, however, that SIPSTACK does not offer short code SMS/MMS numbers, and cannot, therefore, support any SMS/MMS capability for short code numbers. 

## Supported media types for MMS
For a list of file types supported by SIPSTACK MMS, please refer to [MMS Content Types supported by SIPSTACK](http://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/text-messaging/supported-mms-content-types). 

## Sending MMS messages
When you attempt to send an MMS message from a SIPSTACK MMS-enabled number to a recipient on a carrier that does not support MMS, SIPSTACK will convert the message to an SMS with a short URL linking to your media. This includes both international carriers as well as unsupported carriers in Canada and US. These messages will be charged for the cost of the SMS message instead of an MMS. 

## Receiving MMS messages
If you own an MMS-enabled phone number, your phone number is capable of receiving MMS messages from Canada and US long code phone numbers. Make sure that your number is configured to receive messages.
