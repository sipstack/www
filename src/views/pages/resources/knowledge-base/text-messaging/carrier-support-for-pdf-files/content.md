Please note that PDF files are currently considered an [accepted file type](http://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/text-messaging/supported-mms-content-types) by SIPSTACK. This means we will accept the file you submit to us and send it downstream to the mobile network, as long as it meets that network’s size limit for media files. However, we will not resize or make other adjustments to the file itself for device compatibility. For this reason, it’s important to ensure your PDF files are smaller than the maximum attachment size of the network you are sending toward. 

## Long code MMS support for PDF files 
Fido, Rogers and Telus in Canada and AT&T in US. do not support PDF attachments in MMS messages sent via long codes (standard 10-digit local numbers) toward subscribers on their networks.

For users on these mobile networks, a PDF file attachment on an MMS message will not reach the device. The user will receive the Body text of your message (if one was included), with the following text appended: “One or more of the message components have been deleted by MMS Adaptation. Either the message was too large or the components were unsuitable for your handset.”

As of today, long code MMS messaging is considered a person-to-person (P2P) channel by most mobile networks in Canada and US. These mobile networks may choose to extend support to PDF files via long code MMS at a later date. However, SIPSTACK is not aware of any specific plans relating to PDF support via long code.

## Short Code SMS not supported by SIPSTACK
SIPSTACK does not offer short code numbers and therefore, does not support any short code SMS/MMS capabilities. 

## WhatsApp and other messaging channels
The above information is applicable to MMS messaging. Other messaging channels such as WhatsApp have different rules and file type support. PDF files are an officially supported media attachment type for WhatsApp users.
