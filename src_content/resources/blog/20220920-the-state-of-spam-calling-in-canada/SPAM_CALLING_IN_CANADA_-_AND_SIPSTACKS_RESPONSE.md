# THE STATE OF SPAM CALLING IN CANADA

Spam calling has become more than a nuisance in Canada. Nearly 5% of the revenue from Canada's telecom industry, amounting to $381 million, was lost to fraud and spam calling in 2021. In 2019, Canadians received an average of 12.2 spam calls per month. Last year, 106,947 reports of fraud calls were reported to The Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (CAFC). Currently, it is estimated that up to 25% of all calls made across mobile networks in Canada are spam or fraud calls. 

## The top five types of scams in Canada 

Fraudsters have become sophisticated and detailed in their approach, causing Canadians to lose millions of dollars. Here are the top five types of scams Canadians lost money to in 2021:

1. **Investment scams** cost Canadians $70 million. Scammers would create fake accounts and advice people to invest in cryptocurrencies on fake websites. 
2. **Romance scams** cost Canadians $42.2 mullion. Criminals used social media and dating sites to create fake profiles and build virtual relationships with people so they could eventually solicit money out of them. Sometimes, these relationships take years to build. 
3. **Spearfishing scams** cost Canadians $38 million. Scammers sent texts and made calls pretending to be the government, a business or someone you know who's trying to access your accounts. In the last year alone, spammers have been able to spoof several government agencies including Service Canada, Justice Canada, the Federal Court, Department of National Defence, the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre, the Canada Revenue Agency, the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Canada Border Services Agency and the Census Bureau of Canada. 
4. **Merchandising scams** cost Canadians $5.6 million in losses. This is the type of scam in which a criminal would use a classified ad or a fake website to sell concert tickets, puppies, vehicles or even rent out apartments. 
5. **Service scams** cost Canadians $4.8 million. Here, scammers pretended to offer services for credit cards, insurance or phone plans in an effort to get access to your personal information such as your credit card or bank account. 

## The technology behind telecommunication sams

As the technology behind Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gets more sophisticated, so do the techniques used by fraudsters to outsmart fraud prevention. Let's look at a few of the more prevalent ones:

1. **Wangiri:** Wangiri is a Japanese word that means "ring and cut". Typically, these are designed to be zero-duration calls to mobile numbers. The next time you receive a call with an obscure country code that only rings once, you can rest assured that someone is is trying to reel you in for a Wangiri scheme. Your phone will only ring once, often at odd hours, when you're less likely to be by your phone. When you see the missed call, and call the number back, it will get rerouted to a premium-rate number overseas for which you will get charged by your telecom provider.
2. **Caller ID spoofing:** Caller ID is the name and phone number associated with the line used to make a call. While there are legitimate reasons why businesses will need to change their caller ID information (for example, a call center serving multiple clients will want to display the right information about their client to each caller), it is illegal to spoof a caller ID when it is not in the best interest of the customer. Spammers typically manipulate the Caller ID to misrepresent their identity in order to gain the trust of the customer. They will either pretend to be a local caller (called neighbouring), mirror the Caller ID information of the person being called (called mirroring) or display the information of a reputable organization. In some cases, the Caller ID is modified to represent a number that cannot be dialed. This spoofing is designed to elicit personal information from the customer, which is later used to defraud the customer out of thousands of dollars. 
3. **Short stopping:** In this scheme, a hacker hijacks a call before it reaches its target destination by working with a rogue carrier on the call's path. The hacker then directs the call to an expensive calling destination. Sometimes, the caller will get a false ring tone or a fake network message such as *The person you have called cannot be reached. Please try again later.* The hackers and rogue carriers share the revenue generated by these calls, which are either billed to the customer or another carrier in the routing flow. 
4. **Call Stretching:** This scam is run by fraudulent carriers to charge more money to their upstream, legitimate carriers. First, they record a portion of a conversation of an active call. After a few minutes, they drop the call on one side, while keeping on the other caller on hold by playing the recorded audio repeatedly. In the time in takes for the second caller to realize that the call has been disconnected, the fraudulent carrier successfully inflated the duration of the call. Since the legitimate carriers measure how much they pay out against how long each call was, they end up paying more to the fraudulent carriers than they actually owe. And each second means additional income for the fraudster, and additional loss for the main carrier. 
5. **Interconnect Bypass:**: Any calling destination with a strict international traffic regulation is almost an inevitable target for this type of fraud. Typically, the fraudster is a local operator who illegally obtains SIMs and installs it on a device known as a GSM gateway, or SIM Box. The fraudsters then use this device to route international calls through the targeted network as if they were local calls generated by the carrier’s customers. So, while the upstream carrier gets charged an international rate, the fraudsters only pay for a local call (which can be very zero if they’re lucky with the retain plan on the SIMs). The fraudsters pocket the difference between the international and local calling rates. 
6. **PBX Hacking:** One of the most common and significant types of telecom fraud is PBX Hacking. A PBX, or Private Branch Exchange, is a private telephone network within an organization that connects the business to an external network, allowing users to share outside lines and reducing the number of lines needed. When a fraudster hacks into a PBX, they can run up a big bill initiating international calls, resulting in unauthorized charges for the PBX/business owner. 
7. **Wangiri 2.0:** This takes missed calling to a whole new level. In this type of fraud, bots or script fill out a company’s online forms, which lead to companies calling back these numbers - which actually turn out to be premium numbers, and end up costing the business that’s making the calls quite a lot of money.
