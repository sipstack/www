On November 1st, 2022, the CRTC held its first cross-border meeting to discuss strategies to help combat the growing concerns of telecommunication fraud. In addition to the Canadian hosts, the in-person meeting included regulators from Ireland, Hong Kong, Australia, and the United States. 

The participants shared insights on current initiatives to help protect against scam communications, as well as explored options for greater international collaboration. They agreed to continue to collaborate and share strategic information with one another, as well as to seek further engagement from other regulatory agencies of jurisdictions impacted by telecom fraud. 

The meeting expanded on an existing collaboration between regulators through the Unsolicited Communications Enforcement Network (UCENet). It also preceded the International Regulators Forum and International Institute of Communicationsâ€™ Annual Conference held in Ottawa from November 1st-4th, 2022.
