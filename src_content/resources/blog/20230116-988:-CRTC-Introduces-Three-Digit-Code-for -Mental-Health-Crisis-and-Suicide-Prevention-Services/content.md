On December 5th, 2022, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) introduced a three-digit code for mental health crisis and suicide prevention services, as part of Telecom Regulatory Policy 2022-234 (TRP 2022-234). The three-digit code to provide access to these services is **9-8-8**.

As part of TRP 2022-234, the CRTC noted that the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), who is the government agency responsible for overseeing <a href= 'https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-stir-messaging/' target="_blank"> Talk Suicide Canada </a>, would provide it with information regarding the termination point for calls made to the proposed three-digit code as soon as it becomes available. The Commission therefore proposed that calls to **9-8-8** are to be routed to the termination point (1-8XX number) determined by PHAC at a later date, once it has made such a determination. 

The Commission directed telecommunication service providers (TSPs) to transition to ten-digit local dialing by May 31st, 2023 (except in numbering plan areas NPA 867 outside the Yellowknife local interconnection region, and NPA 506 in New Brunswick). 

They have also directed TSPs to implement any other required changes for the implementation of the three-digit code by November 30th, 2023, or within six months after PHAC files a letter with the CRTC, which would direct TSPs and all parties to establish which specific 1-8XX number calls to the three-digit code should be routed, and then launch the code on that date. 

On December 5th, 2022, the Commission received a letter from PHAC, which provided recommendations as to which 1-8XX number calls to 9-8-8 should be routed. The letter indicated that considering the infrastructure in place for <a href= 'https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-stir-messaging/' target="_blank"> Talk Suicide Canada </a>, calls to 9-8-8 are to be routed to the existing national phone number: <a href="tel:+18665803625">1-833-456-4566</a>. As a result, the CRTC have confirmed that the termination point (1-8XX number) of calls made to 9-8-8 will indeed be 1-833-456-4566.
