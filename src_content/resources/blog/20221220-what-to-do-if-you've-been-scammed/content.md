Telecommunication fraud continues to grow exponentially, with reported losses in 2021 of $383 million in [Canada](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-canada)[^1] and a whopping $30 billion in the [United States](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-the-US).[^2] Now more than ever, it is important to recognize that if you have been a victim of a scam, your telephone carrier has responsibilities and steps they should be taking in retribution. Here are some of the measures we recommend taking if you or a loved one suspect you’ve been scammed.

## Report the Scam

Reporting the scam is always the best place to start, as it will provide documentation and potentially help protect others from falling victim to the same scam. Here is a [comprehensive list](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/what-do-if-you-were-scammed) of places to report to, depending on what specific scam was used against you.

## Report Identity Theft
If you suspect you have had your identity stolen, report the incident to the [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.identitytheft.gov/#/). They will help to devise a thorough plan to recover and ensure your safety. 

## Contact Credit Bureaus

If you have had any financial data stolen, notify your credit bureaus and the Social Security Administration. They can help freeze your accounts and put steps in place to prevent any further damages.

## Notify the Police
Scamming is against the law, which means it is a criminal activity. Reporting scams to your local police authorities will result in a police report, which could help recoup some of your losses.

## Notify Relevant Businesses or Agencies
Scammers often masquerade as legitimate businesses or agencies. If this occurred in your scam, it’s wise to report the fraudulent activities to the actual company they were pretending to be. This allows for the business to issue warnings to the public, which can help protect others from falling victim to similar types of scams.

## Secure Relevant Devices
While many scams attempt to gather personal or financial information, some try to gain access to your accounts to harvest your data. We recommend keeping your phone and computer software up to date and changing your passwords regularly, but especially after falling victim to a scam.
