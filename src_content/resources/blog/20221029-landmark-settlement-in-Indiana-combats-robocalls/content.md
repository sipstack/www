Attorney General Todd Rokita publicly announced his settlement on October 20th,  after a  yearlong battle against Startel Communications LLC and its CEO, Wanda Hall. In October 2021 Rokita filed a suit against Startel, an Indiana firm, along with other perpetrators involved with aiding and abetting foreign robocallers. Although the robocallers operating out of India, Phillipines and Singapore named in the original suit were not named in the settlement, it is still a massive win for telecommunication safety. 

The settlement prohibits both Startel and Hall from the telecommunications industry all together, indefinity. Both Startel and its CEO agreed to never operate or work with a voice service provider to any degree. The lawsuit stated that Startel acted as a gateway provider for over 4.8 million illegal robocalls to Indiana alone and hundreds of millions of calls across the U.S.<sup>1</sup> Scams included but are not limited to: IRS and Social Security Administration imposter scams, legal action or arrest scams, computer support scams, Apple support scams and Amazon subscription scams. This historic win sets precedence for other telecom companies who enable robocalls flooding into the U.S.
