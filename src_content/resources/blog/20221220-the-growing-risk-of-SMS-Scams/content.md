## SMS Scams: Smishing

Like phishing, but for SMS, smishing refers to messages that pretend to be sent from someone the recipient knows, prompting them to click a fraudulent link that will cause their personal details to be leaked and tracked. Both the content of the message, and the alleged sender of the message, can vary widely, but there is always one common trait: The messages will attempt to sound legitimate by mentioning some type of urgent action that is required on the recipient’s part, which will result in them getting scammed. 

## Common Examples of Smishing

1. Delivery scams: Text messages that say they are from a common delivery service like FedEx or Amazon, claiming that there is some issue with the recipient’s delivery. Delivery scams are especially prevalent during the holidays https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/ho-ho-holiday-scams when online shopping ramps up.

2. Banking scams: Text messages that say they are from the recipient’s bank or other financial institution, such as PayPal, claiming that there is some issue with their account. 

3. Personal contact: Text messages claiming they are sent from somebody the recipient knows, or in some cases, a friend of a friend. These may be sent with a local number using Caller-ID Spoofing https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/general/what-is-call-spoofing to trick the recipient.

4. Rewards and Promotions: Text messages that tempt the recipient to click a link by claiming they have won some kind of reward or promotion.
