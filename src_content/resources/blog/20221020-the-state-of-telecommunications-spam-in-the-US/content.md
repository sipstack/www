## **The technology behind telecommunication scams**

Scams and frauds rely on a multitude of advanced technology to outsmart fraud prevention. Below are the five most prevalent advancements in technology that are leveraged in scams.

1.  **Wangiri:** Wangiri is a Japanese term directly translating to "one ring and cut" <sup>9</sup>. Like the translation suggests, the victims’ phone will only ring once, often at odd hours, when calls are less likely to be answered. When victims return the call, it will get rerouted to a premium-rate number overseas for which they will get charged by their telecom provider.
2.  **Caller ID spoofing:** CNAM, is the [**C**aller **NAM**e, and CID, is the **C**aller **ID**](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/general/what-is-cnam) or phone number that is displayed when receiving a call. While call centres may have permission to duplicate their clients’ CNAM and/or CID, it is illegal to replicate and imitate a CID without permission. Spammers either utilize the numbers of reputable companies or individuals within the same area code of the victim to gain their trust.
3.  **Short stopping:** In this scheme, a hacker hijacks a call before it reaches its target destination by working with a rogue carrier on the call's path. The hacker the redirects the call to an international phone number, allowing hackers to surcharge their victim. Sometimes, the caller will hear a false ring tone or a doctored network message such as _The person you have called cannot be reached. Please try again later._ The hackers and rogue carriers share the revenue generated by these calls, which are either billed to the customer or another carrier in the routing flow.
4.  **Call Stretching:** This scam is run by fraudulent carriers to charge more money directly from legitimate carriers. A portion of live conversation is recorded from an active call which is played to one caller, after the other caller is dropped. The time it takes for the second caller to realize that the call has been disconnected and hangs up, is time that fraudulent carrier has successfully added to the duration of the call. Legitimate carriers measure pay out according to the duration of the call and so they end up paying more to the fraudulent carriers than they actually owe. While this may only add seconds, when conducted on a massive scale this technology can generate significant revenue.
5.  **PBX Hacking:** One of the most common and significant types of telecom fraud is PBX Hacking. A PBX, **P**rivate **B**ranch **E**xchange, is a private telephone network within an organization. It connects the business to an external network, allowing users to share outside lines while reducing the number of lines needed. When one hacks into a PBX, they can run up a big bill initiating international calls, resulting in unauthorized charges for the PBX/business owner.

## **What the US government is doing to fight fraud**

The **FCC** **F**ederal **C**ommunications **C**ommission is overseeing the implementation and maintenance of [STIR/SHAKEN](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/regulatory/what-is-stir-shaken), in efforts to deter illegal caller ID spoofing. **STIR,** **S**ecure **T**elephony **I**dentity **R**evisited, and **SHAKEN**, **S**ignature-based **H**andling of **A**sserted information using to**KENs** work separately to authenticate caller information.

However, Americans are a far way from being fully protected from caller ID spoofing. The FCC has granted extensions up until June 2023 for carriers with fewer than 100,000 subscribers. Once STIR/SHAKEN is implemented, numbers can only be verified if the device is compatible, and both carriers of a call have adopted the guidelines. While STIR/SHAKEN provides guidelines for authentication, no third party management exists to monitor the CID validation process, leaving each carrier to implement their own standards. Additionally, a majority of CID spoofing occurs when an individual is hacked. Calls made with this stolen ID will still be validated by STIR/SHAKEN as it is unable to identify the caller behind the phone number.
