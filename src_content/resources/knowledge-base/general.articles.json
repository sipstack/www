Canadians have reported losses of $383 million in 2021 alone to telecommunication fraud, costing victims exponentially more money than ever before.<sup>1</sup> As spam calling and texting has become a growing concern, it’s important to be aware of the prevalent scams both in the [US](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-the-US) and [Canada](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-canada). Increased awareness helps protect ourselves and loved ones against fraud. One of the most prevalent of these telecommunications scams is called Wangiri.  

Wangiri is a Japanese term that translates to _one ring and cut_, referring to a phone call that rings just one time before disconnecting. Typically, these calls will occur at nighttime or working hours in order to intentionally go unanswered and be displayed as a missed call in the call log. The intention is to have victims call the number back, which is then re-routed to an IPRN, International Premium Rate Number, or another number that charges excessively high fees.<sup>2</sup>  Oftentimes, victims receive multiple calls from the same premium-rate number, or even text messages, to influence them to call the number back.<sup>3</sup> This is known as the first leg of the Wangiri attack.  

The second leg occurs once the victim actually calls the number back. The motivation of the scammer then becomes to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible. To this end, they typically use a recording centered around a lottery win, gambling, or other adult-themed content to entice the victim to stay on the line.<sup>4</sup> The longer the call is, the more expensive the fees are, most of which are paid to the scammer.
 

## Signs of a Wangiri Call
Here are a few telltale signs to look out for:
1)	The phone will ring for only a short amount of time before disconnecting.
2)	The call occurs at nighttime or working hours.
3)	The number has an unusual international country code.

## Takeaways and Tips to Protect Yourself
Keep the following in mind to keep yourself safe against Wangiri fraud:
1)	If you notice you have a missed call from a number unfamiliar to you, do not call back. As tempting as it may be to want to know whose call you missed, it’s important to remember that legitimate callers trying to reach you will often leave a voicemail.
2)	If you are receiving a lot of these calls, report it to your phone provider. 
3)	If you have already been charged for calling one of these numbers back, you can report the crime to the police.<sup>5</sup>

Call stretching is a method utilized by fraudulent carriers to inflate the duration of a call, and effectively charge more money directly from legitimate carriers. It is amongst the five most prevalent telecommunications schemes in the [US]( https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-the-US) and [Canada](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-canada). As telecom operators and government agencies work to target a specific type of fraud, more complex and innovative methods are utilized by scammers.  Call stretching manages to bypass most skilled fraud management systems.<sup>1</sup> 

This is carried out in one of two ways. The basic scenario is continuing to keep the line active for several seconds after the call has been terminated by the other party. The more intricate scheme involves the recording of a portion of live conservation. A portion of the other party’s voice is played immediately after the originating party disconnects. It often takes many seconds, or even a few minutes before the party realizes this and hangs up.

Although seeming minuscule, when conducted on a massive scale this method generates over a billion dollars annually.<sup>2</sup> Detection of this fraud is difficult as the call themselves are legitimate, and the profit per call is small. Because originating carriers measure pay out according to the duration of the call, they end up paying more to the fraudulent carriers than they actually owe. Recording a private conversation poses a massive breach in privacy. Call stretching results in carriers having to manage disgruntled subscribers and high customer turnover. 

## What is the solution?
If you are receiving a lot of these calls, report it to your phone provider. Don’t feel obligated to answer each and every call from unknown numbers. It's important to remember that legitimate callers trying to reach you will often leave a voicemail. If you are expecting a call, and you aren't sure whether it is safe, use [Whois]( https://whois.sipstack.com/)  by SIPSTACK. 
Entering the Caller ID displayed will instantaneously provide a score rating out of five stars, as well as other relevant information to help you determine whether the call is safe.

Caller ID is the phone number of an incoming phone call.

## Why does it exist?

There is a variety of fraudulent scams that are rapidly advancing within the ever evolving sphere of telecommunications. A common misconception is that the majority of victims are seniors, given their vulnerable status. Yet millennials are also largely targeted, given the rise in cell phone owners and decline of land line owners. <sup>2</sup>

A 2014 survey revealed that within the last 12 months, in the United States alone, over $8.6 billion dollars were lost to phone fraud.<sup>3</sup> As a result, people have grown distrustful and no longer feel safe answering unknown numbers. Important and relevant calls are missed due to the fear of falling prey to a scam call.

Preventative measures, such as CNAM, work to provide callers with a sense of security.

## Not sure a call is safe?

CNAM is not an automated feature granted to cellphone users. Additionally, there is no centralized database, meaning the name displayed may vary depending on the database chosen by the receiver’s carrier. That is where Whois comes in! If an unknown number is attempting to contact you, and you aren’t sure whether it is safe, use [Whois](https://whois.sipstack.com/) by SIPSTACK. By entering the Caller ID displayed, you will be able to receive reliable information on the security level of the number.

A PBX is a private telephone system used within an organization to communicate internally between users, while also connecting to an external network through shared number of phone lines. While reducing operating costs for businesses, they provide ample opportunity for hacking and fraud through initiating international calls resulting in unauthorized charges for the PBX owner if left unprotected. Users are often unaware of the threat PBX hacking poses and fail to implement protective measures. 


## How to protect yourself 

-	**Change passwords:** Avoid using the default passwords provided by your service provider, as they can be found online and in user manuals. Also, regularly change voicemail passcodes, to non-generic ones. 
-	**Do not post a public call directory:** Although you would like your staff to be available to clients, providing a complete list of **DID**, **d**irect **i**nward **d**ialing numbers (phone numbers), will provide hackers a plethora of options to attempt hacking into, or target individuals directly by name and phone number. 
-	**Use secure VoIP methods:** Using [VoIP]( https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/voip-technology-explained) over secure transports (similar to SSL for websites), **VPN** **V**irtual **P**rivate **N**etwork, or non-standard [**SIP**](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/knowledge-base/general/glossary-telco), **S**ession **I**nterent **P**rotocol, ports deters hackers exponentially. SIP uses **TLS**, **T**ransport **L**ayer **S**ecurity to encrypt traffic and packets between client devices and SIP servers. VPN allows SIP traffic to flow between client devices and SIP servers over public internet as if they exist in the same network. Use of non-standard SIP ports can help hide SIP devices/access from port scanners and sniffers when TLS or VPN is not available.
-	**Close unactive accounts:** When an employee is no longer working for the company it is important to swiftly disable their access and close their mailbox.
-	**Restrict password attempts:** Configure your system so access to outgoing calls and voicemails are locked after three failed password attempts. 
-	**Choose SIPSTACK:** Enabling and managing security measures on every aspect of your telecommunications can be overwhelming. SIPSTACK provides its clients with the utmost security so that you can focus on making your business a success. [Contact us](https://www.sipstack.com/contact/us) to learn more.

As telecommunication fraud continues to grow each year, with reported losses in 2021 of $383 million in [Canada](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-canada)<sup>1</sup> and $30 billion in the [United States](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/the-state-of-spam-calling-in-the-US)<sup>2</sup>, it’s becoming increasingly important to stay informed and vigilant. Total telecom-related losses in 2021 amounted to $39.89 billion, a 28% increase from 2020. Of those total losses, $4 billion were at the hands of a scam called Short Stopping. 

## What is Short Stopping?
Short Stopping refers to a scam where hackers hijack a call before it reaches its target destination. By working with a rogue carrier on the call's path, the hacker redirects the call to an expensive destination country, causing the victim to get surcharged. The hackers and the rogue carriers then share the revenue generated by the fraudulent calls by billing either the end customer or another carrier in the routing flow.

Once a call has been short-stopped, the motivation of the hacker becomes to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible. The longer the call, the higher the charge. To this end, scammers use a number of different tactics. 

## Potential Tactics to Watch Out For
•	Providing a false ring tone or a fake network announcement that might say something like, “The person you are calling has not responded. Please try again later.”
•	Playing a prerecorded message such as, “Hello? Hello? I can't hear you. Hold on…"
•	Rerouting the call to a call center where a real person attempts to keep the conversation going with similar tactics. 

## How Short Stopping Impacts Callers
Because these recordings or conversations are meant to seem legitimate, callers are often not even aware that any fraud has taken place until they receive an exorbitant bill for calls to a destination they never dialed. A further inconvenience is that some operators will block the numbering plans of costly countries altogether in order to protect themselves from this scam. This makes customers who legitimately need to reach these countries unable to do so.

## Why Short Stopping is Difficult to Stop
Short Stopping is difficult both to detect and crack down upon because the fraud happens after a legitimate call is placed. The fraudulent element of the call is able to conveniently hide within the initial legitimate call, allowing it to go unnoticed by the systems put in place to catch it. It is especially difficult to track because the per-call profit margin is so small that it goes unnoticed. Unfortunately, the millions of small-scale calls being hijacked on a global scale allow the fraudsters’ cumulative profits to add up substantially. To put it simply, detecting Short Stopping is like trying to find a needle in a haystack. 

## How SIPSTACK Fights Fraud
Using the latest technology and machine learning, SIPSTACK's systems authenticates all activity in real time against variables that affect your security. When a carrier implements SIPSTACK's Risk Rating Score, they are able to customize a threshold for calls to pass through, based on their specific needs. At SIPSTACK we take an active role in ensuring we are building a secure and connected tomorrow. [Contact us](https://www.sipstack.com/contact/us) today to learn how you can protect yourself from spam.

Amongst the various [Smart CNAM lookup types](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/docs/smart-cnam), the score/risk lookup function provides a dynamic score on a scale from 0.000-5.000.  SIPSTACK's proprietary algorithm uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to uniquely weigh a number of factors to determine the score assigned to each call. It is important to note that carriers have internal scores, contributing to the risk calculations. As the carrier continues to interact with our [partner portal]( https://www.sipstack.com/resources/docs/partner-portal), [cloud UC]( https://www.sipstack.com/products/cloud-uc) and continue to use other services, their internal score will go up. This strengthens the trust behind their clients’ phone numbers and as a result, provide their clients with higher scores. Conversely, deceitful actions of the carrier, not only lowers the carrier’s score but all of their clients scores as well. The algorithm is ever-evolving to provide the best possible security to our customers. 

| Score | Remarks| 
|---|---|   
| <1  | Blacklisted |  
| 1-1.499 | Fraud |  
| 1.5-1.999 | Spam |  
| 2-2.499 | Spam Likely |  
| 2.5-3 | Spam Possible/Recovering |  
| 3-4 | Safe |  
| 4-5 | Trusted |  

*Table 1 - SIPSTACK's suggested remarks based on score ranges*


### Steps to take 
Carriers can determine their own safety threshold, in relation to the risk calculations and offer customers the option to block calls below this threshold. Alternatively, carriers can let individual customers determine what score they deem is safe, for their unique needs, and block calls below their individually determined safety threshold. Remarks associated with our risk calculations are automatically provided to the carrier, in association with the score. Carriers can display these to their customers at their discretion. Ultimately, SIPSTACK allows individual carriers to interpret scores and determine safety thresholds independently.

Enhanced 911 or E-9-1-1 is a system utilized in North America that provides the caller’s location to emergency services. 9-1-1 dispatchers are able to retrieve physical addresses of landlines, and geographic coordinates of wireless callers, which is then passed on to police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and other services as deemed fit. Enhanced location information works to improve the effectiveness and reliability of wireless 911 services.  

### Canada mandates the following from local [VoIP service providers](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/voip-technology-explained): 

1. To provide either basic or E-9-1-1 service to their customers.    
2. To provide customers with adequate and accessible notifications of any service limitations with respect to their 9-1-1 or E-9-1-1 services.    
3. To register with the **CRTC**, **C**anadian **R**adio-television and **T**elecommunications **C**ommission, as a reseller. If the company owns and controls transmission facilities, it has to register with the Commission as a **CLEC**, **C**ompetitive **L**ocal **E**xchange **C**arrier.    
4. To obtain a **BITS**, **B**asic **I**nternational **T**elecommunication **S**ervice, license from the CRTC, if the company operates internationally.  
5. Companies are required to keep up to date with all ongoing regulatory filings to maintain their BITS license and registration. Failure to do so could lead to deregistration and loss of the BITS license.
