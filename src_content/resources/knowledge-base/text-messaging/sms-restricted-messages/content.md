SIPSTACK’s [Acceptable Use Policy](https://www.sipstack.com/aup)(AUP) describes the agreement between you and SIPSTACK regarding the use of SIPSTACK’s product and service.

The following behaviors are not permitted when sending and receiving SMS messages using SIPSTACK. (Please note that the following restrictions apply to the owner of the SIPSTACK account as well as to all their end users.)

## Sending unsolicited messages
No one likes SPAM. You should only send SMS messages to recipients who have opted in to your service and are expecting communication from you. SIPSTACK actively monitors for this kind of activity and we may block the phone number or suspend your account if we receive complaints from your subscribers.

## Sending mass marketing or bulk messaging using SIPSTACK 
Mass marketing restrictions vary from country to country. Mobile carriers do not allow marketing SMS messages, whether solicited or not, to be sent on long codes (10-digit numbers).  SIPSTACK does not support mass marketing on Canadian, US or international phone numbers.

## Sending harassing or abusive messages
Sending threats, unwanted messages and “SMS-bombing” – sending many messages to a single number without the recipient’s permission – are not allowed on SIPSTACK. You are responsible for ensuring that your end users do not send harassing or abusive messages.

## Using SIPSTACK numbers as the only means of communication during an emergency
SIPSTACK phone numbers should not be used for inbound and outbound communications between emergency service providers and end users via text messaging. SMS notifications can be used to provide information during an emergency, but should not be used as a replacement for or a means to contacting actual emergency services. 

It is acceptable to use SIPSTACK to send notifications that do not directly impact life safety. For example, early warning alerts, safety advisories, event cancellations, etc. are allowed. We recommend building in redundancy for important applications and using SIPSTACK’s notifications in conjunction with other public warning systems like sirens, radio and TV broadcasts if applicable.

## Engaging in fraud, phishing or sending of sensitive data
SIPSTACK takes fraud and abuse very seriously. Sending messages with fraudulent information or phishing to request confidential information from subscribers is not allowed. It’s also never a good idea to provide financial information or any other sensitive personal information to your customers over SMS.

## Misrepresenting your identity (no spoofing)
Spoofing the SenderID or otherwise attempting to mislead message recipients as to who is sending the SMS message is not allowed. While it makes good business sense to identify your brand or name in each message you send, it is not acceptable to misrepresent yourself.

## Sending messages with pornographic or objectionable images
Do not send pictures 
- that promote or potentially further any illegal activity,
- violate any legal or federal legislations, or
- are likely to cause offense to recipients. 

These include but are not limited to pornographic or objectionable images.
