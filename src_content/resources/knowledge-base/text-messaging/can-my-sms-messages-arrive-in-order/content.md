SIPSTACK cannot guarantee that SMS messages sent from your SIPSTACK phone number will arrive in order. While we will send the SMS messages you pass to us in the order that youâ€™ve queued them, the SMS messages are delivered individually with no association to each other. The order of delivery depends on the carrier.
