A short code is a 5 or 6-digit number that can send and receive SMS (and MMS) to and from mobile phones. Short codes are recommended for high volume applications.

Short codes may be a random number (in Canada or U.S.), or a vanity number that you pick. A vanity short code is a specific number of your voice, while a random short code is assigned to you and canâ€™t be reviewed in advance.
