SIPSTACK cannot guarantee the deliverability of SMS messaging to roaming phone numbers.

If you send an SMS message to a phone number roaming in an area other than where it normally operates, the SMS message may not arrive. In some cases, duplicate messages may be delivered. 

SIPSTACK does not have the ability to determine whether or not the phone number you are sending SMS messages to is roaming at the time the SMS request is initiated.
