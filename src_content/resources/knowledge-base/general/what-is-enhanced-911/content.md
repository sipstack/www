Enhanced 911 or E-9-1-1 is a system utilized in North America that provides the callerâ€™s location to emergency services. 9-1-1 dispatchers are able to retrieve physical addresses of landlines, and geographic coordinates of wireless callers, which is then passed on to police officers, firefighters, paramedics, and other services as deemed fit. Enhanced location information works to improve the effectiveness and reliability of wireless 911 services.  

Canada mandates the following from local [VoIP service providers](https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/voip-technology-explained): 

1. To provide either basic or E-9-1-1 service to their customers.  
2. To provide customers with adequate and accessible notifications of any service limitations with respect to their 9-1-1 or E-9-1-1 services.  
3. To register with the CRTC, Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, as a reseller. If the company owns and controls transmission facilities, it has to register with the Commission as a CLEC, Competitive Local Exchange Carrier.  
4. To obtain a BITS, Basic International Telecommunication Service, license from the CRTC, if the company operates internationally. 
Companies are required to keep up to date with all ongoing regulatory filings to maintain their BITS license and registration. Failure to do so could lead to deregistration and loss of the BITS license.
