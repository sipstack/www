**A2P**, Application-to-Person, messaging in the United States allows businesses to leverage a preapproved **10DLC, 10 D**igit **L**ong **C**ode, a phone number, to send mass text messages to consumers. Businesses can register with carriers whom work with **TCR** [**T**he **C**ampaign **R**egistry](https://www.campaignregistry.com/) to offer integrated registration for approval, or directly with the TCR themselves. Businesses must acquire approval for both their brand and each campaign in efforts to increase transparency in the messaging ecosystem.

## Existing Alternatives

While 10DLC is not the only option for businesses, each alternative comes with its own caveats.

**Toll-free long codes**: While 1-800 numbers are an affordable option with a high throughput rate of thousands a day, it requires a separate step of obtaining approval for the third party number. Additionally, using a toll-free number significantly reduces customer engagement and experience as it appears impersonal and foreign to consumers.

**Short codes**: While using this 5/6 digit option has an impressive throughput rate of millions a day, purchasing short codes is an expensive ordeal. Acquiring approval for short codes is a long process, unfit for todayâ€™s fast paced trends.

**Local long codes**: Standard phone numbers come at no additional cost, but with little applicability. As they are not designed for A2P but rather **P2P** **P**erson-to-**P**erson use, the throughput rate is significantly lower, sitting at a few hundred a day. More importantly A2P messaging with unapproved long codes is against **CITA** **C**ellular **T**elecommunications and **I**nternet **A**ssociation guidelines, meaning these unsanctioned texts are often filtered out by carriers.

## Benefits of 10DLC

A2P 10DLC offers a happy medium of mass text messaging management with low overhead costs, providing an accessible option to US businesses.
