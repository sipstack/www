## How to protect yourself 

-	**Change passwords:** Avoid using the default passwords provided by your service provider, as they can be found online and in user manuals. Also, regularly change voicemail passcodes, to non-generic ones. 
-	**Do not post a public call directory:** Although you would like your staff to be available to clients, providing a complete list of **DID**, **d**irect **i**nward **d**ialing numbers (phone numbers), will provide hackers a plethora of options to attempt hacking into, or target individuals directly by name and phone number. 
-	**Use secure VoIP methods:** Using [VoIP]( https://www.sipstack.com/resources/blog/voip-technology-explained) over secure transports (similar to SSL for websites), VPN (virtual private network) or non-standard SIP ports helps mitigates hackers exponentially. SIP using TLS encrypts traffic and packets between client devices and SIP servers.  VPN allows SIP traffic to flow between client devices and SIP servers over public internet as if they exist in the same network. Use of non-standard SIP ports can help hide SIP devices/access from port scanners and sniffers when TLS or VPN is not available.
-	**Close unactive accounts:** When an employee is no longer working for the company it is important to swiftly disable their access and close their mailbox.
-	**Restrict password attempts:** Configure your system so access to outgoing calls and voicemails are locked after three failed password attempts. 
-	**Choose SIPSTACK:** Enabling and managing security measures on every aspect of your telecommunications can be overwhelming.
