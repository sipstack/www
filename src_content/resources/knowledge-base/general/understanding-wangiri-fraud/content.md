With reported losses of $383 million in 2021 alone, spam calling and texting is becoming a growing concern, costing Canadians exponentially more money than ever before<sup>1</sup>. It’s important to be aware of the various types of scams we’re all susceptible to, so we can have the best chance at protecting ourselves against them. One of the most prevalent of these telecommunications scams is called Wangiri.

Wangiri is a Japanese word that means “one ring and cut” and refers to a phone call that rings just one time before disconnecting. Typically, these calls will occur at nighttime or working hours in order to intentionally go unanswered and be shown later to their victims as a missed call. The intention is to manipulate their victims into calling the number back, which is then re-routed to an International Premium Rate Number (IPRN) or another number that charges excessively high fees<sup>2</sup>. Oftentimes, victims receive multiple calls from the same premium-rate number, or even text messages, to influence them to call the number back<sup>3</sup>. This is known as the “first leg” of the Wangiri attack.

The ”second leg” occurs once the victim actually calls the number back. The motivation of the scammer then becomes to keep the caller on the line for as long as possible. To this end, they typically use a recording centered around a lottery win, gambling, or other adult-themed content to entice the victim to stay on the line<sup>4</sup>. The longer the call is, the more expensive the fees are, most of which are paid to the scammer. 

## Signs of a Wangiri Call
Here are a few telltale signs to look out for:
1)	The phone will ring for only a short amount of time before disconnecting.
2)	The call occurs at nighttime or working hours.
3)	The number has an unusual international country code.

## Takeaways and Tips to Protect Yourself
Keeping these things in mind will help ensure your safety against Wangiri fraud:
1)	If you notice you have a missed call from a number unfamiliar to you, do not call back. As tempting as it may be to want to know whose call you missed, it’s important to remember that legitimate callers trying to reach you will often leave a voicemail.
2)	If you are receiving a lot of these calls, report it to your phone provider. 
3)	If you have already been charged for calling one of these numbers back, you can report the crime to the police<sup>5</sup>.
