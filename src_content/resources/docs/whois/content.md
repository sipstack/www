## How do I register numbers? 
To register a number under a carrier, select Whois Profiles on the left pane. Select the green plus button and fill all required fields under the three tabs: general, location and additional. Transparency helps your own Source/Risk score and the larger goal of creating  safer telecommunications. To maintain privacy, simply toggle the private caller option to hide your information from others. Please note: failing to provide an accurate caller id information may impact your overall score as a carrier.
 
## Can I register a number I don’t own?
If a carrier attempts to register a number that they don’t own, we will be notified when the rightful owner signs up to register. Disciplinary actions will be sanctioned as seen fit, for example, lowering the score of the carrier for deceitful actions. This not impacts the carrier, but can also impact of it’s clients, hurting brand image.
