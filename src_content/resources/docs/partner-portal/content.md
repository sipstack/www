### Can I register a number I don’t own?

If a carrier attempts to register a number that they don’t own, we will be notified when the rightful owner signs up to register. Disciplinary actions will be sanctioned as seen fit, for example, lowering the score of the carrier for deceitful actions. This not impacts the carrier, but can also impact of it’s clients, hurting brand image.
