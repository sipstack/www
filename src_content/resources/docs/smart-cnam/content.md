# Overview
Smart CNAM is the next generation lookup tool. Smart CNAM is immensely more comprehensive than a name response, with the capacity to pull up a tremendous amount of relevant, up to date information. Smart CNAM pairs with Whois Profiles in order to capture and return up to date and relevant caller information.

# Smart CNAM
To access the smart CNAM lookup system, select Smart CNAM on the left pane. 
## Lookup Type
Smart CNAM offers the following various Smart CallerID Lookups:
•	Caller ID: provides the name or location of the source caller. 
•	Regional: provides specific and accurate location of the source caller such as city, region and country.
•	Telco/Carrier: provides information on the source caller’s carrier, company, provider and type of device.
•	Online Profiles: provides the source caller’s public address as well as information on their online presence including any public websites, emails and all available social platform accounts. 
## Running a Lookup
To run a lookup, enter the Source caller and depending on the type of lookup also the Destination Callee then select the lookup type from the drop-down menu and click lookup. The information based on the specific lookup type will be returned under the Results section. Please note standard API charges apply for each type of lookup. 
In order to run Source/ Risk lookup the Destination Callee number must be registered under Whois Profiles found on the left pane. 
## What do Score/Risk scores mean?
Source/Risk scores are rated out of 5. SIPSTACK’s proprietary algorithm uses Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to uniquely weigh a number of factors to determine the score assigned to each call. These are dynamic and change based on a variety of factors. 
Here is a breakdown of the scores: ## How much does it cost
You can find out pricing by clicking on Pricing under Billing. Each lookup incurs an API charge. If you don’t have sufficient funds in your account, the system will return a null result. 

# Whois Profiles
Whois profiles allows you to register and add information relating to the phone numbers that you manage, allowing you to enhance the score rating of those phone numbers. 
## How do I register numbers? 
To register a number under a carrier, select Whois Profiles on the left pane. Select the green plus button and fill all required fields under the three tabs general, location and additional. Transparency helps your own Source/Risk score and the larger goal of creating  safer telecommunications. To maintain privacy, simply toggle the private caller option to hide your information from others. Please note: not providing an accurate caller id may impact your overall score as a carrier. 
## Can I register a number I don’t own?
If a carrier attempts to register a number that they don’t own, we will be notified when the rightful owner signs up to register. Disciplinary actions will be sanctioned as seen fit, for example, lowering the score of the carrier for deceitful actions.
